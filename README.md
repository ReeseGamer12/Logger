# SocialMediaLogger
 Social Media Logger for all social media account management. 

 The purpose of this is to allow me to log twitter, facebook, and instagram posts, then alter release a CSV for uploading to automated posting services. 

 We'll also eventually link this to a cron service for automated direct posting to social media directly, ignoring the companies we'll be piggybacking on until then.

Normally, this application would have all of the normal expected things you'd need for internet security, like passwords, and more than baseline code to prevent injection attacks.

However, since this case is currently only designed for local use, we're not bothering to add all of that. That will however become an update required in future versions of this application. 

Version 1.0.0
-- Local use only.
