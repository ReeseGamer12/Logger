# SocialMediaLogger
 Social Media Logger for all social media account management. 

 The purpose of this is to allow me to log twitter, facebook, and instagram posts, then alter release a CSV for uploading to automated posting services. 

 We'll also eventually link this to a cron service for automated direct posting to social media directly, ignoring the companies we'll be piggybacking on until then.
